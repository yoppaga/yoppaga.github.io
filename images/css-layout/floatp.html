  A float is a box that is shifted to the left or right on the current line.
The most interesting characteristic of a float (or "floated" or "floating" box)
is that content may flow along its side (or be prohibited from doing so by the
'clear' property). Content flows down the right side of a left-floated box and
down the left side of a right-floated box. The following is an introduction to
float positioning and content flow; the exact rules governing float behavior are
given in the description of the 'float' property.
</p>
<p>
A floated box is shifted to the left or right until its outer edge touches the
containing block edge or the outer edge of another float. If there is a line
box, the outer top of the floated box is aligned with the top of the current
line box.

<p>This specification defines Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 revision 1 (CSS
2.1). CSS 2.1 is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach
style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents
and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of documents from
the content of documents, CSS 2.1 simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance.
</p>

<div id="box3"><p>
 If there is not enough horizontal room for the float, it is shifted downward
 until either it fits or there are no more floats present.
 </p><p>
 Since a float is not in the flow, non-positioned block boxes created before and
 after the float box flow vertically as if the float did not exist. However, the
 current and subsequent line boxes created next to the float are shortened as
 necessary to make room for the margin box of the float.
 </p><p>

 A line box is next to a float when there exists a vertical position that
 satisfies all of these four conditions: (a) at or below the top of the line
 box, (b) at or above the bottom of the line box, (c) below the top margin edge
 of the float, and (d) above the bottom margin edge of the float.
 </p><p>

 Note: this means that floats with zero outer height or negative outer height do
 not shorten line boxes.
 </p><p>

 If a shortened line box is too small to contain any content, then the line box
 is shifted downward (and its width recomputed) until either some content fits
 or there are no more floats present. Any content in the current line before a
 floated box is reflowed in the same line on the other side of the float. In
 other words, if inline-level boxes are placed on the line before a left float
 is encountered that fits in the remaining line box space, the left float is
 placed on that line, aligned with the top of the line box, and then the
 inline-level boxes already on the line are moved accordingly to the right of
 the float (the right being the other side of the left float) and vice versa for
 rtl and right floats.
 </p><p>

 The border box of a table, a block-level replaced element, or an element in the
 normal flow that establishes a new block formatting context (such as an element
 with 'overflow' other than 'visible') must not overlap the margin box of any
 floats in the same block formatting context as the element itself. If
 necessary, implementations should clear the said element by placing it below
 any preceding floats, but may place it adjacent to such floats if there is
 sufficient space. They may even make the border box of said element narrower
 than defined by section 10.3.3. CSS2 does not define when a UA may put said
 element next to the float or by how much said element may become narrower.
